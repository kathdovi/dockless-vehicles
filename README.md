# Welcome to the Austin Transportation Department Dev Challenges

### Goals for this exercise

- Show off your skills, creativity, style, and asynchronous collaboration abilities.
- Get a taste of the actual technologies we are using.
- Learn something new and be ready to teach us about it.
- Have fun. Coding should be fun.

### How does this work?

Take an hour or two and play around with the code in this repo. Create something tangible to share with us that demonstrates how you approach ambiguous problems.

- Check out more info in [the frontend challenge](./frontend).

#### A note on time.

We don't want to waste your time so please don't work more 2 or 3 hours on this at most. If time constrants are a real problem for you, let us know and we can discuss alternatives like sending a code sample.
